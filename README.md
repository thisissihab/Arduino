# IndustrialObjectCounter
It was a project that I was intructed to submit for one of my enginnering courses The main function of this project was to count objects in an industrial production line. Motors,
wheels and belts were used to create a simple miniature of industrial production line. An IR obstacle detector was used to detect objects and count them. Arduino was used as the 
main controller. A LCD display eas used to show the number of counted objects.

Used Equipments:
1. Arduino Uno
2. IR Obstacle Detector
3. 200RPM Gear Motor
4. l298n Motor Driver
5. 16x2 LCD Display
6. Mini wheel
7. Connecting Wires
